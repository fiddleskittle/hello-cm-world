If I knew, I'd tell you
It seems that developers, at least those using github, are far more organized than I ever gave them credit for.
There are so many similarities between project management on a large scale and developer collaborations on a project-level. 
I actually like the developer-collab model more, because the process is standardized and automatic.
Create an open-source repository > create a branch > make changes > commit changes > create a pull request 
If only all the stakeholders involved in the projects I coordinate would adhere to such a clear system
Then again, if they did, would I have a job?
